# Traffic
Traffic is an implementation of a neural network built with TensorFlow Keras Sequential Model, that classifies road signs based on images. 

For training and testing the model makes use of the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) labeled dataset, which contains thousands of images of 43 different kinds of road signs.


## Model building process
When building a neural network model, the objective is to **minimize the loss function** and **maximize testing accuracy** (using the least possible resources). In order to do that we have to explore and experiment different network structures and configurations.
